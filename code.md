# Code status — Phase 1

- `app/storefront.tsx`: client homepage composition, mock data, slider, category drawer, reusable `Section` and `ProductCard`.
- `app/globals.css`: global token values and responsive storefront styles.
- `app/page.tsx`: homepage route. `app/layout.tsx`: font and metadata.
- Placeholder assets: `public/images/placeholders/`. Mock data references local image paths, so production assets can replace files with no component redesign.

Run `npm install`, then `npm run build` for production validation. Local assets use `next/image` with `fill`, `sizes`, fixed aspect-ratio wrappers, first hero `priority`, and lazy loading below fold.

Drawer opens from left, locks page scroll, closes with backdrop/Escape, moves focus into drawer, and traps Tab focus while open.
